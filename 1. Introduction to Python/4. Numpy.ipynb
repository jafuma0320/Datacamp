The first list, positions, contains strings representing each player's position. The possible positions are: 'GK' (goalkeeper), 'M' (midfield), 'A' (attack) and 'D' (defense). The second list, heights, contains integers representing the height of the player in cm. The first player in the lists is a goalkeeper and is pretty tall (191 cm).\n\nYou're fairly confident that the median height of goalkeepers is higher than that of other players on the soccer field.
