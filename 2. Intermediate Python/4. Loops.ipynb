In particular, remember to _indent_ the contents of the loop using four spaces or auto-indentation!\n\n**Instructions**\n\n- Create the variable **offset** with an initial value of 8.\n- Code a **while** loop that keeps running as long as offset is not equal to 0. Inside the while loop:\n- Print out the sentence \"correcting...\".\n- Next, decrease the value of offset by 1.
