The code for this plot is available in the script.\n\nAs a first step, let's add axis labels and a title to the plot.

The tick values 1000, 10000 and 100000 should be replaced by 1k, 10k and 100k.

Let's change this. Wouldn't it be nice if the size of the dots corresponds to the population?\n\nTo accomplish this, there is a list pop loaded in your workspace. It contains population numbers for each country expressed in millions. You can see that this list is added to the scatter method, as the argument s, for size.\n\n**Instructions**\n\n- Run the script to see how the plot changes.\n- Looks good, but increasing the size of the bubbles will make things stand out more.\n- Import the numpy package as np.\n- Use np.array() to create a numpy array from the list pop. Call this NumPy array np_pop.\n- Double the values in np_pop setting the value of np_pop equal to np_pop * 2. Because np_pop is a NumPy array, each array element will be doubled.\n- Change the s argument inside plt.scatter() to be np_pop instead of pop.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7bbace48-2702-45ba-8b4e-91f4ad625912"},{"source":"**Colors**\n\nThe code you've written up to now is available in the script.\n\nThe next step is making the plot more colorful!

The Gapminder data contains a list continent with the continent each country belongs to. A dictionary is constructed that maps continents onto colors:\n\ndict = {\n    'Asia':'red',\n    'Europe':'green',\n    'Africa':'blue',\n    'Americas':'yellow',\n    'Oceania':'black'\n}\n\nNothing to worry about now; you will learn about dictionaries in the next chapter.\n\n**Instructions**\n\n- Add c = col to the arguments of the plt.scatter() function.\n- Change the opacity of the bubbles by setting the alpha argument to 0.8 inside plt.scatter().
