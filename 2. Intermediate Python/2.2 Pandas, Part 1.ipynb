{"cells":[{"source":"**Dictionary to DataFrame (1)**\n\nPandas is an open source library, providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python. Sounds promising!\n\nThe DataFrame is one of Pandas' most important data structures. It's basically a way to store tabular data where you can label the rows and the columns. One way to build a DataFrame is from a dictionary.\n\nIn the exercises that follow you will be working with vehicle data from different countries. Each observation corresponds to a country and the columns give information about the number of vehicles per capita, whether people drive left or right, and so on.\n\n_Three lists are defined in the script:_\n\n- names, containing the country names for which data is available.\n- dr, a list with booleans that tells whether people drive left or right in the corresponding country.\n- cpc, the number of motor vehicles per 1000 people in the corresponding country.\n- Each dictionary key is a column label and each value is a list which contains the column elements.\n\n**Instructions**\n\n- Import pandas as pd.\n- Use the pre-defined lists to create a dictionary called my_dict. There should be three key value pairs:\n- key 'country' and value names.\n- key 'drives_right' and value dr.\n- key 'cars_per_cap' and value cpc.\n- Use pd.DataFrame() to turn your dict into a DataFrame called cars.\n- Print out cars and see how beautiful it is.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"403128bd-6a59-4eeb-bd3a-f4f332e49089"},{"source":"# Pre-defined lists\nnames = ['United States', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'India', 'Russia', 'Morocco', 'Egypt']\ndr =  [True, False, False, False, True, True, True]\ncpc = [809, 731, 588, 18, 200, 70, 45]\n\n# Import pandas as pd\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create dictionary my_dict with three key:value pairs: my_dict\nmy_dict = {\n    'country': names,\n    'drives_right': dr,\n    'cars_per_cap': cpc,\n}\n\n# Build a DataFrame cars from my_dict: cars\ncars = pd.DataFrame(my_dict)\n\n# Print cars\nprint(cars)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":4900,"lastExecutedAt":1715922028639,"lastExecutedByKernel":"05bff2b1-524f-40a7-ae68-6af7c6879365","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Pre-defined lists\nnames = ['United States', 'Australia', 'Japan', 'India', 'Russia', 'Morocco', 'Egypt']\ndr =  [True, False, False, False, True, True, True]\ncpc = [809, 731, 588, 18, 200, 70, 45]\n\n# Import pandas as pd\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create dictionary my_dict with three key:value pairs: my_dict\nmy_dict = {\n    'country': names,\n    'drives_right': dr,\n    'cars_per_cap': cpc,\n}\n\n# Build a DataFrame cars from my_dict: cars\ncars = pd.DataFrame(my_dict)\n\n# Print cars\nprint(cars)","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":188,"type":"stream"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"a33cac65-0eeb-47e6-91b6-edc864cdfc2a","outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"         country  drives_right  cars_per_cap\n0  United States          True           809\n1      Australia         False           731\n2          Japan         False           588\n3          India         False            18\n4         Russia          True           200\n5        Morocco          True            70\n6          Egypt          True            45\n"}],"execution_count":1},{"source":"**Dictionary to DataFrame (2)**\n\nThe Python code that solves the previous exercise is included in the script.
